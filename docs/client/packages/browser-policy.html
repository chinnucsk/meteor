## `browser-policy`

The `browser-policy` package lets you set security-related policies that will be
enforced by newer browsers. These policies help you prevent and mitigate common
attacks like cross-site scripting and clickjacking.

`browser-policy` lets you configure the HTTP headers X-Frame-Options and
Content-Security-Policy. X-Frame-Options tells the browser which websites are
allowed to frame your app. You should only let trusted websites frame your app,
because malicious sites could harm your users
with <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking">clickjacking
attacks</a>.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content-Security-Policy</a>
tells the browser where your app can load content from, which encourages safe
practices and mitigates the damage of a cross-site-scripting attack.

For most apps, we recommend that you take the following steps when using
`browser-policy`:

* Call `BrowserPolicy.enableContentSecurityPolicy()` to enable a starter policy
for your app. With this starter policy, your app's client code will be able to
load content (images, scripts, fonts, etc.) only from its own origin, except
that XMLHttpRequests and WebSocket connections can go to any origin. Further,
your app's client code will not be able to use functions such as `eval()` that
convert strings to code.
* You can use the functions described below to customize the content
security policy. If your app does not need any inline Javascript such as inline
`<script>` tags, we recommend that you modify the policy by calling
`BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineScripts()` in server code. This will result in one
extra round trip when your app is loaded, but will help prevent cross-site
scripting attacks by disabling all scripts except those loaded from a `script
src` attribute.
* If your app does not need to be framed by other websites, call
`BrowserPolicy.allowFramingBySameOrigin()` to help prevent clickjacking attacks.

Meteor determines the browser policy when the server starts up, so you should
call `BrowserPolicy` functions in top-level application code or in
`Meteor.startup`.

#### Frame options

You can use the following functions to specify which websites are allowed to
frame your app. By default, any website is allowed.
<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowFraming()"}}
Your app will never render inside a frame or iframe.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.restrictFramingToOrigin(origin)"}}
Your app will only render inside frames loaded by `origin`. You can only call
this function once with a single origin, and cannot use wildcards or specify
multiple origins that are allowed to frame your app. (This is a limitation of
the X-Frame-Options header.) Example values of `origin` include
"http://example.com" and "https://foo.example.com".
{{#warning}}
This value of the X-Frame-Options header is not yet supported in Chrome or
Safari and will be ignored in those browsers.
{{/warning}}
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.restrictFramingToSameOrigin()"}}
Your app will only render inside frames loaded by webpages on the same origin as
your app.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

#### Content options

You can use the functions in this section to control how different types of
content can be loaded on your site. In order to use any of these functions, you
must first call `BrowserPolicy.enableContentSecurityPolicy()`, which enables the
starter policy described above. This section covers additional functions that
you can use to tighten or relax restrictions on what content your app can use.

You can use the following functions to adjust policies on where Javascript and
CSS can be run:

<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowInlineScripts()"}}
Allows inline `<script>` tags, `javascript:` URLs, and inline event handlers.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineScripts()"}}
Disallows inline Javascript. Calling this function results in an extra
round-trip on page load to retrieve Meteor runtime configuration that is usually
part of an inline script tag.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowEval()"}}
Allows the creation of Javascript code from strings using function such as `eval()`.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowEval()"}}
Disallows eval and related functions.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allowInlineStyles()"}}
Allows inline style tags and style attributes.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallowInlineStyles()"}}
Disallows inline CSS.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

Finally, you can configure a whitelist of allowed requests that various types of
content can make. The following functions are defined for the content types
script, object, image, media, font, and connect.

<dl class="callbacks">
{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allow&lt;ContentType&gt;Origin(origin)"}}
Allows this type of content to be loaded from the given origin. `origin` is a
string and can include an optional scheme (such as `http` or `https`), an
optional wildcard at the beginning, and an optional port which can be a
wildcard. Examples include `example.com`, `https://*.example.com`, and
`example.com:*`. You can call these functions multiple times with different
origins to specify a whitelist of allowed origins.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allow&lt;ContentType&gt;DataUrl()"}}
Allows this type of content to be loaded from a `data:` URL.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.allow&lt;ContentType&gt;SameOrigin()"}}
Allows this type of content to be loaded from the same origin as your app.
{{/dtdd}}

{{#dtdd "BrowserPolicy.disallow&lt;ContentType&gt;()"}}
Disallows this type of content on your app.
{{/dtdd}}
</dl>

These functions are also defined for the content type `AllContent`, which is a
shorthand for calling one of the above functions once for each content type.
For example, if you want to allow the origin `https://foo.com` for all types of
content but you want to disable `<object>` tags, you can call
`BrowserPolicy.allowAllContentOrigin("https://foo.com")` followed by
`BrowserPolicy.disallowObject()`.

Other examples of using the `BrowserPolicy` API:

* `BrowserPolicy.disallowObject()` causes the browser to disallow all
`<object>` tags.
* `BrowserPolicy.allowImageOrigin("https://example.com")`
allows images to have their `src` attributes point to images served from
`https://example.com`.
* `BrowserPolicy.allowConnectOrigin("https://example.com")` allows XMLHttpRequest
and WebSocket connections to `https://example.com`.
